    <div class="aboutBullet"> Introduction </div>
    <div class="aboutDesc-type1"> I'm Vishal Shelake, iOS Developer from city of grapes in India called Nashik. </div>
    <div class="aboutDesc-type2"> I've been interested in programming since I was a child, and my first major
      programming project was when I was in ninth grade. It all started with Excel, where I learned that we can use a
      formula to determine the sum of all rows on a specific cell. Later, it piqued my interest, and I began building
      macros in Excel to accomplish various tasks; this is how it all began.

    <div class="aboutBullet"> My Journey </div>

    <div class="aboutDesc-type1"> It all began soon after I realised my interest in computers. </div>

    <div class="aboutDesc-type2"> Today, I'm interested in iOS development because of the high number of iOS users in
      large domestic demographic, as well as Apple's customer-friendly attitude. Learning Swift and understanding the
      inner workings of app development has been a lot of fun for me.<br>
    </div>

    <div class="aboutDesc-type2">
      It's a fascinating tale. When I was growing up, I was used to using Windows computers and was comfortable with the
      Windows environment, so seeing someone using the Mac Operating System was unusual. When I was in college, one of
      my friends brought his MacBook Air, and I had the opportunity to handle it, but to be honest, I had no idea how to
      use it because everything was disregarded as coming from a Windows environment. This piqued my interest in
      learning more about the Apple ecosystem, and I fell in love with it, thus my journey began. When it comes to iOS
      programming,

    <div class="aboutDesc-type2">
      The first few years were quite difficult. I'm not sure where to begin, and I don't have a Mac system to work with.
      Fortunately, I was able to obtain my own Mac Mini, and things became much easier. As I come from an area where I
      am aware of the lack of senior resources to assist me, I chose an out of the box track for me with the same
      effects on any simpler task where I can get stuck, which is very heartbreaking for a fresher developer. A small
      task took me 1 2 weeks to resolve as I learned everything through trial and error, so I am not afraid of any new
      challenges and functionality to be implemented after conducting extensive research.

    <div class="aboutBullet"> My Flutter Journey </div>
    <div class="aboutDesc-type1">
      Hybrid Mobile Application development
    </div>
    <div class="aboutDesc-type2">
      I was given the opportunity to build a hybrid application that supported both Android
      and iOS platforms. I accepted the challenge and began developing the application in react native. However, I soon
      realised that react required me to learn a lot of new languages that took me longer to understand than flutter, so
      I came up with the idea to develop the application in flutter and completed it in two months.
