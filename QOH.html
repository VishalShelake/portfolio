      The game logic was that it was scheduled every thrice a week for 5 to 10 minutes, during which time a live anchor
      came to the app and started the game. While the game was running, users could put the tokens they earned into the
      live game, which were provided sequentially by token numbers. Once a user added more than 5 tokens, they had the
      option of selecting one card from 52 cards.
